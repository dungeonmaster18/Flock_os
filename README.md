# Flock_os
Flock os is team messenger app designed and developed for organisation teams to work together.
I have created some apps on top of that messenger.
For this, I used php,html,javascript for coding. For deployment, I used xampp and ngrok.
Xampp is used to create local server and database.
ngrok is used to connect the localhost via internet.
